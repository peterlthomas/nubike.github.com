	<div class="newsAuthor">Roger C</div>
	<div class="newsDate">13 September 2002</div>
	

	<p><p><strong>Friday 13th September</strong> </p>
<p>Friday signalled the beginning of another very long weekend for two teams from Nottingham. Representing the cream of Nottingham University cycling club was me, Phil G (the out going el presidente), Phil Roger (the touring king of France) and Tom McKay (the man who knows no fear). The other team from Nottingham consisted of Anthony (Freewheel Nottingham), Stuart (friend of Anthonys), James Dymond (Nottingham University) and James Hampshire (Nottingham Trent Uni).</p>
<p>Having arrived in the early afternoon, the decision to find a suitable and strategic spot for the team camps was excruciating and tiring. After long periods of indecision and scouting the campsite we finally agreed on a good spot. Setting up the tents, especially the big cooking tent, yes a cooking tent! Meant relearning physics all over again in order to keep the thing up! The lack of proper tools i.e. a mallet with a head that did not fly off, didnt help the cause. Once camp was established it was late afternoon and light was beginning to fade.</p>
<p>With the late arrival of Phil G and Tom were decided to go on a leisurely reconnaissance lap of the SITS XC course. The course was described as a proper mountain bikers xc course and after one lap it was clear to see why. Long flowing single track, mammoth climbs, fast descents, the course was superb, especially when compared with the Red Bull (semi reclaimed field) course. There was even a water/stream crossing for added excitement! Setting off in fading light ensured that by 7:30pm we couldnt see a thing in the pitch dark of the forest. This consequently resulted in Phil G impaling himself into a tree. Luckily he suffered only minor injuries. An uneventful evening meant that we could get our last good nights sleep until Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday 14th September</strong></p>
<p>The morning had arrived and the excitement was building to the start of the race. After eating, faffing with bikes, and searching for caravan power plugs the start was only two hours away! Leading off the Nottingham Uni team would be Phil R while Anthony would run for the other team. After the normal ramblings of the rider briefing at 1pm the adrenaline rose considerably. What would we be letting ourselves in for?</p>
<p>1:45pm - We made our way down to the start line. Phil G decided to take a strategic camera position, whilst Tom and me looked for a strategic position to put Phil Rs bike. Unfortunately our first position was too strategic and in front of the start line so we had to find another equally strategic spot.</p>
<p>1:55pm - Phil R was rooted on the front row of the starting grid ready to run as if his life depended on it in order to put us in a good position. Everything was ready for the off 1:561:571:58two minutes to go and counting1:59less than a minute twenty second to go 109 and in a moment it was 32...1 and the sound of the horn was in the air.</p>
<p>The competitors were now charging along the course, trying to run as fast as possible to their bikes, although for some people the objective was to run (and walk) as slowly as they could. After about three minutes of running some of the competitors had nearly made it to their bikes. The first competitor, probably a super keen, superb fit xc semi pro rider zoomed past me to collect his bike and then another three were running past. At this point we could see a super fast Phil R about 20 meters away and closing fast in 5th!!! After a super fast and slick handover of his bike and camelback he was off. 40 Minutes later Phil would finish his lap in a stunning 42 minutes and placed in the top 15. For me, Tom and Phil G if would be a hard act to follow but we were all determined to do well and have fun! After a few more minutes had passed Anthony came round for the other team.</p>
<p>After Phil R and Toms lap it was my turn followed by Phil G. Unfortunately my lap started in the worst possible fashion with a puncture within the first 1000m. After that one-hiccup things proceeded smoothly for myself, the rest of the team and the other team. Race wise things were relatively quiet until James H realised that he had forgotten to wear his timing chip, thus costing his team one lost lap! James D also had an eventful early lap. Whilst trying to be courteous and avoid a female rider who had crashed he proceeded to stop and do his best superman impression by flying over the handlebars.</p>
<p>The darkness of the early evening sky started to bring one drama after another for a lot of the teams. Lady luck was about to desert us as well! The first major incident for the Nottingham Uni team involved Phil R losing his chain on a descent. This meant he had to run for about 4 miles. On my second night lap I also suffered with chain problems, which cost more time. And Phil G didnt escape either! Suffering a puncture literally within 100m of the start line. Worst was to follow for the other team with Stuart suffering in the region of 7 punctures!!! And nobody even stopped to help him until a solo rider came along!</p>
<p>The night laps also kept the St Johns Ambulance volunteers working hard. The majority of the casualties at one stage all seemed to be coming from Nottingham University. Firstly there was James D opening up an old Les Gets knee wound. And then I followed in similar fashion also opening up old leg wounds from Les Gets. Lastly Phil G joined the walking wounded suffering cuts. By early morning the riding had taken its toll on Phil G and we were thus down to three riders. This meant even shorter rests for me, Phil R and Tom.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday 15th September</strong></p>
<p>By now we were more than half way through the race and well into Sunday. Sleep deprivation and stomach problems were evident within our camp but despite these problems both teams pressed on with the finishing straight approaching. Tom and his battle hardened Specialized bike through all the traumas we were having seemed immune from everything, which is all credit to him!</p>
<p>As dawn broke the smell of breakfast and bacon was in the air. This smell for me made me hungrier but also feeling more sick than ever! At least the trails were now easier to ride and lap times were again lowering. Things within both teams had now reached a peak of normality again after the chaos of the night. Both teams were pressing hard for good finishes.</p>
<p>With the last lap approaching Phil G resurfaced from his sleep and volunteered to do the final lap for Nottingham Uni. Reenergized but fragile, Phil G took over from Phil R before the 24 hour horn sounded for the teams last lap of the race. For the rest of us it was time to relax, eat, shower and sleep. Unfortunately due to our miscalculation in the estimation of Phil Gs lap times the Nottingham Uni welcome party missed his arrival at the finishsorry Phil!!!</p>
<p>So that was it! It was finished! The last 24 hour race of the year was done and dusted! After a brief rest the prize giving took place and it was thus time to pack up and leave!</p>
<p>In time honoured tradition here are the awards for the weekend::</p>
<p><strong>Fame and fortune award</strong> - Phil Gradwell (for his appearance on Bikemagic.com)<br><strong>Courtesy in crashing award</strong> - James Dymond<br><strong>The fastest and the slowest lap award</strong> - Phil Rogers<br><strong>The rigid single speed I am hard award</strong> - passes from Phil G to James Hampshire (who also wins the wheres my timing chip award)<br><strong>Climbing award</strong> - Roger Cheng (for getting over that final climb twice)<br><strong>Mr Dependability award</strong> - shared between Tom McKay (for his super solid/fast performances) + Anthony<br><strong>Most punctures in a lap award</strong> - Stuart (who can beat 7?)</p>
<p>Also respect goes to Marc Basiliere (Freewheel Nottingham) for riding the event SOLO!!!</p>
<p>A big thanks goes out to the following people and organisations::</p>
<p>St John Ambulance service - For treating me, James D and Phil G<br>Jackets - For providing food in a time of need<br>SIS - For providing free energy drink refills<br>The massage tent - For curing all our aching limbs and bones<br>Shimano Service Truck - For fixing my bike<br>Vistalite - For providing a free recharging service</p>
